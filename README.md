## What are libraries in python?
- A Python library is a reusable chunk of code that you may want to include in your programs/ projects.
- It contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. As we don't need to write the same code again and again for different programs.
- Examples of libraries:
  - Numpy (Numerical python)
  - SciPy (Scientific Python)
  - PyGame (Gaming interface)
  - Pandas (Data science)


## Benefits of libraries in python
- Libraries help reduce coding errors, make programmers more efficient, and make software smaller in size (and lines of code). Instead of writing long lines of code to accomplish a common task, coders can simply call upon a library – often with a single line of code – to perform that task instead.


## What are modules in python
- In Python, Modules are simply files with the “. py” extension containing Python code that can be imported inside another Python Program. In simple terms, we can consider a module to be the same as a code library or a file that contains a set of functions that you want to include in your application.
- To use modules in python there are two powerful keywords that are used which are `from` or `import`.
- For example `from math import pi` this imports only the pi function from the math module.
- Examples of modules:
  - math
  - random
  - sys
  - os
  - datetime


## Packages in python
- A Python package usually consists of several modules. Physically, a package is a folder containing modules and maybe other folders that themselves may contain more folders and modules. Conceptually, it’s a namespace. This simply means that a package’s modules are bound together by a package name, by which they may be referenced.

## How to install packages in python
- `Pip` is used to install packages in python. It is powerful package manager. Pip is the standard package manager for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional packages that are not part of the Python standard library.
